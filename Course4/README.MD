# Programming Assignment #1 (Week 1)
# Bellman-Ford algorithm

1.Question 1
In this assignment you will implement one or more algorithms for the all-pairs shortest-path problem. Here are data files describing three graphs:

g1.txt
g2.txt
g3.txt
The first line indicates the number of vertices and edges, respectively. Each subsequent line describes an edge (the first two numbers are its tail and head, respectively) and its length (the third number). NOTE: some of the edge lengths are negative. NOTE: These graphs may or may not have negative-cost cycles.

Your task is to compute the "shortest shortest path". Precisely, you must first identify which, if any, of the three graphs have no negative cycles. For each such graph, you should compute all-pairs shortest paths and remember the smallest one (i.e., compute minu,vâˆˆVd(u,v), where d(u,v)d(u,v) denotes the shortest-path distance from uu to vv).

If each of the three graphs has a negative-cost cycle, then enter "NULL" in the box below. If exactly one graph has no negative-cost cycles, then enter the length of its shortest shortest path in the box below. If two or more of the graphs have no negative-cost cycles, then enter the smallest of the lengths of their shortest shortest paths in the box below.

OPTIONAL: You can use whatever algorithm you like to solve this question. If you have extra time, try comparing the performance of different all-pairs shortest-path algorithms!

OPTIONAL: Here is a bigger data set to play with.

For fun, try computing the shortest shortest path of the graph in the file above.

# Programming Assignment #2 (Week 2)
# TSP problem

In this assignment you will implement one or more algorithms for the traveling salesman problem, such as the dynamic programming algorithm covered in the video lectures. Here is a data file describing a TSP instance.

tsp.txt
The first line indicates the number of cities. Each city is a point in the plane, and each subsequent line indicates the x- and y-coordinates of a single city.

The distance between two cities is defined as the Euclidean distance --- that is, two cities at locations (x,y)(x,y) and (z,w)(z,w) have distance sqrt{(x-z)^2 + (y-w)^2} between them.

In the box below, type in the minimum cost of a traveling salesman tour for this instance, rounded down to the nearest integer.

OPTIONAL: If you want bigger data sets to play with, check out the TSP instances from around the world here. The smallest data set (Western Sahara) has 29 cities, and most of the data sets are much bigger than that. What's the largest of these data sets that you're able to solve --- using dynamic programming or, if you like, a completely different method?

HINT: You might experiment with ways to reduce the data set size. For example, trying plotting the points. Can you infer any structure of the optimal solution? Can you use that structure to speed up your algorithm?
