# 1.Question 1
# In this assignment you will implement one or more algorithms for 
# the all-pairs shortest-path problem. Here are data files describing 
# three graphs:

# g1.txt
# g2.txt
# g3.txt
# The first line indicates the number of vertices and edges, respectively. 
# Each subsequent line describes an edge (the first two numbers are its tail 
# and head, respectively) and its length (the third number). NOTE: some of 
#  edge lengths are negative. NOTE: These graphs may or may not have 
# negative-cost cycles.

# Your task is to compute the "shortest shortest path". Precisely, you must 
# first identify which, if any, of the three graphs have no negative cycles. 
# For each such graph, you should compute all-pairs shortest paths and 
# remember the smallest one (i.e., compute minu,vâˆˆVd(u,v), where d(u,v)d(u,v) 
# denotes the shortest-path distance from uu to vv).

# If each of the three graphs has a negative-cost cycle, then enter "NULL" 
# in the box below. If exactly one graph has no negative-cost cycles, then 
# enter the length of its shortest shortest path in the box below. If two or 
# of the graphs have no negative-cost cycles, then enter the smallest of the 
# lengths of their shortest shortest paths in the box below.

# OPTIONAL: You can use whatever algorithm you like to solve this question. 
# If you have extra time, try comparing the performance of different 
# all-pairs shortest-path algorithms!

# OPTIONAL: Here is a bigger data set to play with.

# large.txt
# For fun, try computing the shortest shortest path of the graph in the 
# file above.
