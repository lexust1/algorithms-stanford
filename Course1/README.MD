# Programming Assignment #1 (Week 1)
# Karatsuba multiplication algorithm

In this programming assignment you will implement one or more of the integer
  multiplication algorithms described in lecture.

To get the most out of this assignment, your program should restrict itself
  to multiplying only pairs of single-digit numbers. You can implement 
  the grade-school algorithm if you want, but to get the most out of 
  the assignment you'll want to implement recursive integer multiplication 
  and/or Karatsuba's algorithm.

So: what's the product of the following two 64-digit numbers?

[TIP: before submitting, first test the correctness of your program on some 
  small test cases of your own devising. Then post your best test cases to 
  the discussion forums to help your fellow students!]

[Food for thought: the number of digits in each input number is a 
power of 2. 
  Does this make your life easier? Does it depend on which algorithm 
  you're implementing?]

The numeric answer should be typed in the space below. So if your answer is 
1198233847, then just type 1198233847 in the space provided without 
any space / commas / any other punctuation marks.

(We do not require you to submit your code, so feel free to use any 
  programming language you want --- just type the final numeric answer 
  in the following space.)


# Programming Assignment #2 (Week 2)
# Compute inversion
Download the following text file:

IntegerArray.txt
This file contains all of the 100,000 integers between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive) in some order, with no integer repeated.

Your task is to compute the number of inversions in the file given, where the i^{th}i 
th
  row of the file indicates the i^{th}i 
th
  entry of an array.

Because of the large size of this array, you should implement the fast divide-and-conquer algorithm covered in the video lectures.

The numeric answer for the given input file should be typed in the space below.

So if your answer is 1198233847, then just type 1198233847 in the space provided without any space / commas / any other punctuation marks. You can make up to 5 attempts, and we'll use the best one for grading.

(We do not require you to submit your code, so feel free to use any programming language you want --- just type the final numeric answer in the following space.)

[TIP: before submitting, first test the correctness of your program on some small test files or your own devising. Then post your best test cases to the discussion forums to help your fellow students!]
