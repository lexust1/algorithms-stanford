# The file contains the edges of a directed graph. Vertices are labeled 
# as positive integers from 1 to 875714. Every row indicates an edge, 
# the vertex label in first column is the tail and the vertex label 
# in second column is the head (recall the graph is directed, and the edges 
# are directed from the first column vertex to the second column vertex). 
# So for example, the 11^{th}11th row looks liks : "2 47646". This just 
# means that the vertex with label 2 has an outgoing edge to the vertex 
# with label 47646

# Your task is to code up the algorithm from the video lectures for 
# computing strongly connected components (SCCs), and to run this algorithm 
# on the given graph.

# Output Format: You should output the sizes of the 5 largest SCCs in the 
# given graph, in decreasing order of sizes, separated by commas 
# (avoid any spaces). So if your algorithm computes the sizes of the five 
# largest SCCs to be 500, 400, 300, 200 and 100, then your answer should 
# be "500,400,300,200,100" (without the quotes). If your algorithm finds 
# less than 5 SCCs, then write 0 for the remaining terms. Thus, if your 
# algorithm computes only 3 SCCs whose sizes are 400, 300, and 100, then 
# your answer should be "400,300,100,0,0" (without the quotes). 
# (Note also that your answer should not have any spaces in it.)

# WARNING: This is the most challenging programming assignment of 
# the course. Because of the size of the graph you may have to manage 
# memory carefully. The best way to do this depends on your programming 
# language and environment, and we strongly suggest that you exchange tips 
# for doing this on the discussion forums.
